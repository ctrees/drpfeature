you surely can!  You'll need to do some work to create a BootEnv to do this - we don't have a stock one

details on how to make PXE boot w/ RancherOS is available at:

ok @Dingo - if you are willing to experiment and hack around a bit - here is a basic RancherOS set of bootenv/stages that works.  
WARNING WARNING:  THIS WILL NOT WORK ON YOUR METAL 
this was tested by "borrowing" the Packet.net provisioning script - to provision this (successfully) in Packet.net environment
you WILL HAVE TO MODIFY the `bootenvs/rancheros.yml` kernel options to get a different config file you define
you WILL HAVE TO MODIFY the `rancher-packet-provisioning-script.sh` to work for your metal and environment
WARNING:  I've never used Rancher before - but I was able to boot this against DRP endpoint in packet.net without any problems

_IF_ you had a packet.net account you could test this and it'd work with the following commands/notes:
* for packet.net need `console=ttyS1,115200n8` parameter applied to machine
* untar the above TGZ
* create bootenv: `drpcli bootenvs create -< bootenvs/rancheros.yml`
* create stage: `drpcli stages crate -< stages/rancheros.yml`
* add ISO image:  `drpcli bootenvs uploadiso rancheros-latest-install` (edited)

sort out the customizations in the provisioning steps you need for your bare metal
then set a machine to the `rancheros-latest-install` stage 
and off you go
